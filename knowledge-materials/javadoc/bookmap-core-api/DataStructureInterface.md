# DataStructureInterface

**Package:** velox.api.layer1.messages.indicators

**Type:** Interface

## Description

Interface used by strategies to interact with data structure

## Nested Classes

- `DataStructureInterface.StandardEvents` (enum)
- `DataStructureInterface.TreeResponseInterval` - Tree structure response for given interval

## Methods

### get

```java
ArrayList<DataStructureInterface.TreeResponseInterval> get(long t0, long intervalWidth, int intervalNumber, String alias, DataStructureInterface.StandardEvents[] interestedEvents)
```

Query for standard events
Returns list, containing aggregation from start time to t0 exclusive, followed by list of aggregations for the interval
[t0, t0 + intervalWidth * intervalNumbers), divided by intervalNumber parts

**Parameters:**
- `t0` - Start time (inclusive)
- `intervalWidth` - 
- `intervalNumber` - 
- `alias` - 
- `interestedEvents` - Array of standard tree events that should be returned

**Returns:** 0th element is aggregation from start time to t0 exclusive
     elements 1 to intervalNumber are aggregations of following intervals

---

### get

```java
List<DataStructureInterface.TreeResponseInterval> get(Class<?> strategyClass, String generatorName, long t0, long intervalWidth, int intervalNumber, String alias, Class<?>[] customEvents)
```

Query for custom events. All events in this request must be generated by the same generator, owned by this strategy.
If you need events from more then 1 generator, do multiple gets
Returns list, containing aggregation from start time to t0 exclusive, followed by list of aggregations for the interval
[t0, t0 + intervalWidth * intervalNumbers), divided by intervalNumber parts

**Parameters:**
- `strategyClass` - Class of strategy that owns generator
- `generatorName` - Name of generator that generated events (same as one given to `Layer1ApiUserMessageAddStrategyUpdateGenerator`) constructor
- `t0` - Start time (inclusive)
- `intervalWidth` - 
- `intervalNumber` - 
- `alias` - 
- `customEvents` - Array of value classes (provided in `GeneratedEventInfo.valueClass`) for custom events you want to retrieve

**Returns:** 0th element is aggregation from start time to t0 exclusive
     elements 1 to intervalNumber are aggregations of following intervals

---

### get

```java
List<Object> get(Class<?> strategyClass, String generatorName, long t0, long t1, String alias) throws IllegalArgumentException
```

Query for custom events. Returns all events in range [t0, t1), generated by this generator

**Parameters:**
- `strategyClass` - Class of strategy that owns generator
- `generatorName` - Name of generator that generated events (same as one given to `Layer1ApiUserMessageAddStrategyUpdateGenerator`) constructor
- `t0` - Start time (inclusive)
- `t1` - End time (exclusive)
- `alias` - 

**Returns:** List of events, created by generator in time range [-inf, t1]. Events are sorted in order they were generated
     and have ascending `CustomGeneratedEvent.getTime()`

**Throws:**
- `IllegalArgumentException` - If this generator uses aggregated events

---

### get

```java
DataStructureInterface.TreeResponseInterval get(long t1, String alias, DataStructureInterface.StandardEvents[] interestedEvents)
```

Similar to `get(long, long, int, String, StandardEvents[])` but
returns a single aggregation from the first event to t1. [-inf, t1]

**Parameters:**
- `t1` - 
- `alias` - 
- `interestedEvents` - Array of standard tree events that should be returned

**Returns:** Aggregation [-inf, t1] for given events

---

### get

```java
DataStructureInterface.TreeResponseInterval get(Class<?> strategyClass, String generatorName, long t1, String alias, Class<?>[] customEvents)
```

Similar to `get(Class, String, long, long, int, String, Class[])` but
returns a single aggregation from the first event to t1. [-inf, t1]

**Parameters:**
- `strategyClass` - Class of strategy that owns generator
- `generatorName` - Name of generator that generated events (same as one given to `Layer1ApiUserMessageAddStrategyUpdateGenerator`) constructor
- `t1` - 
- `alias` - 
- `customEvents` - Array of value classes (provided in `GeneratedEventInfo.valueClass`) for custom events you want to retrieve

**Returns:** Aggregation [-inf, t1] for given events

---

### get

```java
List<? extends CustomGeneratedEvent> get(Class<?> strategyClass, String generatorName, long t1, String alias) throws IllegalArgumentException
```

**Parameters:**
- `strategyClass` - Class of strategy that owns generator
- `generatorName` - Name of generator that generated events (same as one given to `Layer1ApiUserMessageAddStrategyUpdateGenerator`) constructor
- `t1` - 
- `alias` - 

**Returns:** List of events, created by generator in time range [-inf, t1]. Events are sorted in order they were generated
     and have ascending `CustomGeneratedEvent.getTime()`

**Throws:**
- `IllegalArgumentException` - If this generator uses aggregated events
